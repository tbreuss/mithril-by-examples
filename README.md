# Mithril by Examples

> The missing addition to Mithril.js website with many up-to-date code examples that are often searched for and just work...

<https://mithril-by-examples.tebe.ch>

## What is this?

`Mithril by Examples` was created for (me and) new users to learn Mithril.js — a javascript framework for building brilliant applications.

This website is simply a wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground - and contains numerous Mithril code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run.

And the best thing is: The code snippets are up-to-date and just work!
