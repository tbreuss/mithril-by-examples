# Mithril.js by Examples

> The missing addition to Mithril.js website with many up-to-date code examples that are often searched for and just work...

<https://mithril-by-examples.js.org>

## What is this?

`Mithril.js by Examples` was created for new users including me to learn Mithril.js - a JavaScript framework for building brilliant applications.

This website itself is a simple wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground.
It contains numerous Mithril.js code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run.
Besides that all examples can be searched or can be listed by tags, contributes, or levels.

But the best thing is: The code snippets are up-to-date and just work!
