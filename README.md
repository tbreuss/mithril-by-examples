## What is this?

`Mithril.js by Examples` was created for (me and) new users to learn Mithril.js â€” a javascript framework for building brilliant applications.

This website is simply a wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground - and contains numerous Mithril.js code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run.

And the best thing is: The code snippets are up-to-date and just work!
