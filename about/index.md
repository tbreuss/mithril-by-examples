*Mithril.js by Examples* was created for new users including me to learn Mithril.js - a JavaScript framework for building brilliant applications.

The website itself is a simple wrapper for the wonderful [Flems](https://flems.io) - a static browser code playground.
It contains numerous Mithril.js code samples that can be seen, reviewed and run by the help of Flems.
Besides that all examples can be searched or can be listed by tags, contributes, or levels.

But the best thing is: The code snippets are up-to-date and just work!

It was built using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), a simple static site generator, together with a few other fancy things.
